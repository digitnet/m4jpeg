								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">JPEG is a standardized image compression 
								mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic 
								Experts Group, the original name of the 
								committee that wrote the standard. JPEG is 
								designed for compressing either full-color or 
								gray scale digital images of &quot;natural&quot;, real 
								world scenes. It does not work very well on 
								non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line 
								drawings. JPEG does not handle black - and - 
								white
								(l - bit - per - pixel) images, nor does it 
								handle motion picture compression.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">Regular JPEG is &quot;lossy&quot;. meaning that the image 
								that gets out of decompression isn't quite 
								identical to what originally put in. The 
								algorithm achieves much of its compression by 
								exploiting known limitations of the human eye, 
								notably the fact that small color details aren't 
								perceived as well as small details of 
								light-and-dark. This way of achieving 
								compression is by psycho visual redundancy and 
								inter-pixel redundancy. Thus, JPEG is intended 
								for compressing images that will be looked at by 
								humans. The JPEG standard includes a separate 
								lossless mode, but it is rarely used and does 
								not give nearly as much compression as the lossy 
								mode.</font></p>

								Outline of the Baseline Compression Algorithm:</b><br>
								<br>
								<b>1.</b>&nbsp; Image is transformed into a 
								suitable color space. This is a no-op for 
								grayscale, but for color images we generally 
								want to transform RGB into a 
								luminance/chrominance color space (YCbCr, YUV, 
								etc). The luminance component is grayscale and 
								the other two axes are color information. The 
								reason for doing this is that we can afford to 
								lose a lot more information in the chrominance 
								components than we can in the luminance 
								component. The human eye is not as sensitive to 
								high-frequency chroma info as it is to 
								high-frequency luminance. However, compression 
								will be less since we will have to code all the 
								components at luminance quality. The color-space 
								transformation is slightly lossy due to round 
								off error, but the amount of error is much 
								smaller than what we typically introduce later 
								on.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066"><b>
								2.</b> The pixel values for each component are 
								grouped into 8x8 blocks. Each 8x8 block is 
								transformed through a discrete cosine transform 
								(DCT). The DCT is a relative of the Fourier 
								transform and likewise gives a frequency map, 
								with 8x8 components. Thus we now have numbers 
								representing the average value in each block and 
								successively higher-frequency changes within the 
								block. The motivation for doing this is that we 
								can now throw away high-frequency information 
								without affecting low-frequency information.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066"><b>
								3.</b> In each block, each of the 64 frequency 
								components are divided by a separate 
								&quot;quantization coefficient&quot;, and the results are 
								rounded to integers. This is the fundamental 
								Information-losing step. The larger the 
								quantization coefficients, the more data are 
								discarded. Even the minimum possible 
								quantization coefficient, 1, loses some info. 
								because the exact DCT outputs are typically not 
								integers. Higher frequencies are always 
								quantized less accurately (given larger 
								coefficients) than lower, since they are less 
								visible to the eye. Also, the luminance data is 
								typically quantized more accurately than the 
								chroma data, by using separate 64- element 
								quantization tables. Tuning the quantization 
								tables for best results is something of a black 
								art, and is an active research area. Most 
								existing encoders use simple linear scaling of 
								the example tables given in the JPEG standard, 
								using a single user-specified &quot;quality&quot; setting 
								to determine the scaling multiplier. This works 
								fairly well for midrange qualities but is quite 
								non optimal at very high or low quality 
								settings.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066"><b>
								4.</b> These quantized 8X8 blocks are scanned in 
								a zigzag passion. While scanning only those 
								frequency components, which are of interest, are 
								selected and remaining are neglected. Basically 
								zigzag scan is performed to retain DC and Low 
								frequency information and neglect high frequency 
								information.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066"><b>
								5.</b> Zigzag coefficients are encoded using 
								Run length and Huffman coding. This step is 
								lossless, so it doesn't affect image quality.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066"><b>
								6. </b>Tack on appropriate headers, etc, and 
								output the result. In a normal &quot;interchange&quot; 
								JPEG file, all of the compression parameters are 
								included in the headers so that the decompressor 
								can reverse the process. These parameters 
								include the quantization tables and the Huffman 
								coding tables. For specialized applications, the 
								spec permits those tables to be omitted from the 
								file; this saves several hundred bytes of 
								overhead, but it means that the decompressor 
								must know a-priori what tables the compressor 
								used. Omitting the tables is safe only in closed 
								systems.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The decompression algorithm reverses this 
								process. The decompressor multiplies the reduced 
								coefficients by the quantization table entries 
								to produce approximate DCT coefficients. Since 
								these are only approximate, the reconstructed 
								pixel values are also approximate, but if the 
								design has done what it's supposed to do, the 
								errors won't be highly visible. A high-quality 
								decompressor will typically add some smoothing 
								steps to reduce pixel-to-pixel discontinuities.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The JPEG standard does not specify the exact 
								behavior of compressors and decompressors, so 
								there's some room for creative implementation. 
								In particular, implementations can trade off 
								speed against image quality by choosing more 
								accurate or faster-but-less-accurate 
								approximations to the DCT. Similar tradeoffs 
								exist for the down sampling/up sampling and 
								colorspace conversion steps. (The spec does 
								include some minimum accuracy requirements for 
								the DCT step, but these are widely ignored, and 
								are not too meaningful anyway in the absence of 
								accuracy requirements for the other lossy 
								steps.)</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066"><b>Extensions:</b><br>
								<br>
								The progressive mode is intended to support 
								real-time transmission of
								images. It allows the DCT coefficients to
								be sent piecemeal in multiple &quot;scans&quot; of
								the image. With each scan, the decoder
								can produce a higher-quality rendition of
								the image. Thus a low-quality preview
								can be sent very quickly, then refined as
								time allows. The total space needed is
								roughly the same as for a baseline JPEG image of 
								the same final quality. The decoder must do 
								essentially a full JPEG decode cycle for each 
								scan: inverse DCT, up sample, and color 
								conversion must all be done again, not to 
								mention any color quantization for 8-bit 
								displays. So this scheme is useful only with 
								fast decoders or slow transmission lines.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066"><b>
								Conclusions:</b><br>
								<br>
								Image compression is an extremely important part 
								of modern computing. By having the ability to 
								compress images to a fraction of their original 
								size, valuable (and expensive) disk space can be 
								saved. In addition, transportation of images 
								from one computer to another becomes easier and 
								less time consuming (which is why image 
								compression has played such an important role in 
								the development of the Internet). The JPEG image 
								compression algorithm provides a very effective 
								way to compress images with minimal loss in 
								quality. Although the actual implementation of 
								the JPEG algorithm is more difficult than other 
								image formats, (such as GIF) and the actual 
								compression of images is expensive 
								computationally, the high compression ratios 
								that can be routinely attained using the JPEG 
								algorithm easily compensate for the amount of 
								time spent implementing the algorithm and 
								compressing an image.</font></p><hr>
