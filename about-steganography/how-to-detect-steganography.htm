								Steganalysis : How to Detect Steganography</b></font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								<br>
								Steganalysis is the discovery of the existence 
								of hidden information; therefore, like 
								cryptography and cryptanalysis, the goal of 
								steganalysis is to discover hidden information 
								and to break the security of its carriers. In 
								order to know how the steganalysts work, and 
								what techniques and methods they use, we suggest 
								reading what has been published by the Steganography Analysis and Research Center (<b>SARC</b>) 
								:</font><p align="left">
								<b><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#A80054">
								&quot;Blind&quot; Steganography Detection:</font></b><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The 
								blind detection approach to steganalysis has 
								been around for a number of years. Blind 
								detection attempts to determine if a message may 
								be hidden in a file without any prior knowledge 
								of the specific steganography application used 
								to hide the information. Several techniques may 
								be employed to inspect suspect files including 
								various visual, structural, and statistical 
								methods.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Visual analysis methods attempt to detect the 
								presence of steganography through visual 
								inspection, either with the naked eye or with 
								the assistance of automated processes. Visual 
								inspection with the naked eye can succeed when 
								steganography is inserted in relatively smooth 
								areas with nearly equal pixel values. Automated 
								computer processes can, for example, decompose 
								an image into its individual bit-planes. A 
								bit-plane consists of a single bit of memory for 
								each pixel in an image, and is a typical storage 
								place for information hidden by steganography 
								applications. Any unusual appearance in the 
								display of the least significant bit-plane would 
								be expected to indicate the existence of 
								steganography.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Structural analysis methods attempt to reveal 
								alterations in the format of the data file. For 
								example, a steganography application may append 
								hidden information past an image's end-of-file 
								marker. An image that has been modified using 
								this appending technique is interpreted by the 
								operating system just as if it were the original 
								carrier file. The two files are visually and 
								digitally identical, because the image's data 
								bits have not been altered. The hidden 
								information that is embedded past the 
								end-of-file marker is simply ignored by the 
								operating system. Several automated methods for 
								conducting structural analysis have been 
								developed in addition to the manual process of 
								investigating images with a hex editor.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Statistical analysis methods attempt to detect 
								tiny alterations in a file's statistical 
								behavior caused by steganographic embedding. 
								Statistical analysis of files can be difficult 
								and time consuming, since there are a variety of 
								approaches to embedding—each modifying the 
								carrier file in a different way. Therefore, 
								unified techniques for detecting steganography 
								using this method are difficult to find. 
								Determining statistics such as means, variances, 
								and chi-square tests can measure the amount of 
								redundant information and/or deviation from the 
								expected file characteristic. Current research 
								in blind detection steganalysis is focused on 
								these statistical methods.</font><p align="justify">
								<br>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066"><u>
								Complications of Blind Detection </u><br>
								<br>
								In practice, even if the blind detection 
								technique detects anomalies in suspect files, it 
								is not very likely that the hidden information 
								can successfully be extracted. It is often not 
								possible to identify the particular 
								steganography application used to embed hidden 
								information within the suspect file using 
								current blind detection algorithms. The suspect 
								file may have characteristics similar to an 
								anomaly that will trigger a false positive 
								result. Even if it is possible to extract the 
								hidden information, which is highly unlikely 
								using only a blind detection approach, the 
								hidden information may have been encrypted prior 
								to being embedded in the carrier file.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The 
								following four complications are possible when 
								implementing blind detection techniques for 
								steganalysis: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •The suspect file may or may not have any information hidden 
								in it in the first place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •The hidden message may have been encrypted before being 
								hidden in the carrier file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •Some suspect files may have had noise or irrelevant data 
								encoded in them which reduces the stealth aspect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i.e., makes it easier to detect use of 
								steganography) but makes analysis very 
								time-consuming.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •Unless the hidden information can be found, completely 
								recovered, and decrypted (if encrypted), it is 
								often not possible to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be sure whether the suspect carrier file 
								contained a hidden message in the first 
								place-all the user end up with is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probability that the suspect carrier file may 
								have something hidden within it.</font><p align="justify">&nbsp;<hr width="75%">
								<p align="left"><b>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#A80054">
								&quot;Analytical&quot; Steganography Detection:</font></b><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The 
								analytical approach to steganalysis has been 
								developed by the Steganography Analysis and 
								Research Center as a byproduct of extensive 
								research of steganography applications and the 
								techniques they employ to embed hidden 
								information within files. The premise of this 
								approach is to first determine if any residual 
								file and/or Microsoft Windows Registry artifacts 
								from a particular steganography application 
								exist on the suspect media.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">&nbsp; 
								•&nbsp; If residual artifacts exist, then the 
								application was probably installed.<br>
&nbsp; •&nbsp; If the application was installed, then it was probably used.<br>
&nbsp; •&nbsp; If the application was used, then something was probably hidden 
								using it.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The 
								analytical approach attempts to determine if 
								there is any evidence that a steganography 
								application ever existed on the suspect media. 
								Searching for files and registry entries that 
								have been identified by the SARC as belonging to 
								a steganography application will identify these 
								residual artifacts. The goal is to determine 
								what application was used, what type(s) of 
								carrier files it may have been used on, and 
								finding what was hidden by that particular 
								application.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The 
								analytical approach to steganalysis is intended 
								to be an extension of traditional computer 
								forensics practices. For example, all deleted 
								files and alternate data streams should be 
								recovered using traditional forensics utilities 
								prior to conducting steganalysis.<br>
								<br>
								<u>The Steganography Application Library</u></font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The 
								SARC maintains a library of steganography, 
								watermarking, and other data-hiding applications 
								by routinely searching the Internet for 
								freeware, shareware, and licensed applications. 
								When found, an application is downloaded and 
								catalogued with the application name, date and 
								time of download, and location it was found on 
								the Internet. Each application is installed, 
								tested, and examined before being added to the 
								library.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The 
								Internet is dynamic and ever changing—a 
								steganography application that appears on a 
								certain website may not be available when a 
								computer forensic examiner needs to access it at 
								a later date. Thus, the SARC also maintains a 
								physical repository containing archive copies of 
								all applications on CD-ROM. This repository may 
								be consulted by computer forensic examiner on a 
								fee-for-service basis if artifacts of an 
								application are discovered during an examination 
								and the original application is no longer 
								available.</font><p align="justify"><u>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Process for Analytical Steganalysis</font></u><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">To 
								determine if residual file artifacts of 
								steganography applications exist on the suspect 
								media, the SARC has developed the Steganography 
								Application Fingerprint Database (SAFDB). The 
								SAFDB contains file profiles associated with 
								hundreds of steganography, watermarking, and 
								other data-hiding applications. These file 
								profiles contain identifying information such as 
								filename, file size, associated application 
								name, and several unique hash values: CRC-32, 
								MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-256, 
								and SHA-512. These hash values may be used to 
								determine the presence of artifacts of 
								steganography applications on the media being 
								examined.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">The 
								first step in the analytical approach is to hash 
								all files on the suspect media. Next, compare 
								the generated hash values with those in the 
								SAFDB. A match represents a file artifact that 
								may be associated with one or more steganography 
								applications. Each file profile within the SAFDB 
								identifies which steganography application that 
								artifact belongs to.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Once a list of potential steganography 
								applications has been compiled, carrier file 
								types that can be manipulated by those 
								applications should be identified. To accomplish 
								this, the computer forensic examiner should 
								download and experiment with that application. 
								Next, a focused search should be conducted on 
								the suspect media for carrier file types that 
								are manipulated by the particular steganography 
								application. Finally, the suspect carrier files 
								can be subjected to further analysis based on 
								the specific steganographic techniques that can 
								be used on them.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Once the steganographic technique has been 
								determined, it may be possible to extract the 
								hidden information. If strong encryption has 
								been used prior to hiding the information in the 
								carrier file, then complex cryptanalysis may 
								also be necessary to decrypt the extracted 
								information.</font><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Research conducted in the SARC has revealed that 
								some steganography applications leave behind 
								signatures, or specific byte patterns, that 
								always appear in a file after hidden information 
								has been embedded. The signature discovery 
								process can be very time consuming because each 
								steganography application must be individually 
								analyzed to determine how the application embeds 
								information. Once a signature is discovered, an 
								automated process must be developed to search 
								every potential carrier file for that particular 
								signature.</font><p align="justify">&nbsp;<hr>
