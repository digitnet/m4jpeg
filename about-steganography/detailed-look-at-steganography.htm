								A detailed look at Steganography</font></b><p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								<br>
								Lets look at what a theoretically perfect secret 
								communication (Steganography) would consist of. 
								To illustrate this concept, we will use three 
								fictitious characters named Amy, Bret and 
								Crystal. Amy wants to send a secret message (M) 
								to Bret using a cover (C) which can be sent to 
								Bret without raising suspicion. Amy then changes 
								the cover message (C) to a stego-object (S) by 
								embedding the secret message (M) into the cover 
								message (C) by using a stego-key (K). Amy should 
								then be able to send the stego object (S) to 
								Bret without being detected by Crystal. Bret 
								will then be able to read the secret message (M) 
								because he knows the stego-key (K) used to embed 
								it into the cover message (C).</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">In 
								a perfect system, a normal cover should not be 
								distinguishable from a stego-object, neither by 
								a human nor by a computer looking for 
								statistical patterns. In practice, however, this 
								is not always the case. In order to embed secret 
								data into a cover message, the cover must 
								contain a sufficient amount of redundant data or 
								noise. This is because the embedding process 
								Steganography replaces this redundant data with 
								the secret message. This limits the types of 
								data that we can use with Steganography.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">In practice, there are basically three types of 
								steganographic protocols used. They are Pure 
								Steganography, Secret Key Steganography and 
								Public Key Steganography. Pure Steganography is 
								defined as a steganographic system that does not 
								require the exchange of a cipher such as a 
								stego-key. This method of Steganography is the 
								least secure means by which to communicate 
								secretly because the sender and receiver can 
								rely only upon the presumption that no other 
								parties are aware of this secret message.
								Secret Key Steganography is defined as a 
								steganographic system that requires the exchange 
								of a secret key (stego-key) prior to 
								communication. Secret Key Steganography takes a 
								cover message and embeds the secret message 
								inside of it by using a secret key (stego-key). 
								Only the parties who know the secret key can 
								reverse the process and read the secret message. </font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">Public Key Steganography takes the concepts from 
								Public Key Cryptography as explained below. 
								Public Key Steganography is defined as a 
								steganographic system that uses a public key and 
								a private key to secure the communication 
								between the parties wanting to communicate 
								secretly. The sender will use the public key 
								during the encoding process and only the private 
								key, which has a direct mathematical 
								relationship with the public key, can decipher 
								the secret message. Public Key Steganography 
								provides a more robust way of implementing a 
								steganographic system because it can utilize a 
								much more robust and researched technology in 
								Public Key Cryptography.</font></p>

								Text-based steganography:</font></b></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Encoding secret messages in text can be a very 
								challenging task. This is because text files 
								have a very small amount of redundant data to 
								replace with a secret message. Another drawback 
								is the ease of which text based Steganography 
								can be altered by an unwanted parties by just 
								changing the text itself or reformatting the 
								text to some other form (from .TXT to .PDF, 
								etc.). There are numerous methods by which to 
								accomplish text based Steganography. Below a few 
								of the more popular encoding methods are 
								introduced.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Line-shift encoding involves actually shifting 
								each line of text vertically up or down by as 
								little as 3 centimeters. Depending on whether 
								the line was up or down from the stationary line 
								would equate to a value that would or could be 
								encoded into a secret message.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Word-shift encoding works in much the same way 
								that line-shift encoding works; only we use the 
								horizontal spaces between words to equate a 
								value for the hidden message. This method of 
								encoding is less visible than line-shift 
								encoding but requires that the text format 
								support variable spacing.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Feature specific encoding involves encoding 
								secret messages into formatted text by changing 
								certain text attributes such as 
								vertical/horizontal length of letters such as b, 
								d, T, etc. All three of these text-based 
								encoding methods require either the original 
								file or the knowledge of the original files 
								formatting to be able to decode the secret 
								message.</font></p>
								<p align="justify"><b>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#A80054">
								hyper text-based steganography:</font></b></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Steganography with hypertext can also be done a 
								variety of different ways, like the text files 
								the hyper text files have a small amount of 
								redundant data to replace with a secret message 
								so encoding secret messages in hyper text can be 
								a very challenging task so it has the same 
								drawbacks of the text-based steganography.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								There are numerous methods by which to 
								accomplish hyper text-based Steganography, we 
								have the same methods that have been mentioned 
								in text-based steganography, line-shift encoding 
								and word-shift encoding. In addition hiding data 
								could be performed by use of Hypertext comment 
								notations that can take place within the 
								hypertext file.
								In other hand we can hide secret messages in the 
								web visible page by a special Arrangement of the 
								contents on a given web page or by the presence 
								or absence of content elements like images and 
								phrases.</font></p>
								<p align="justify"><b>

								Audio-based Steganography:</font></b></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Encoding secret messages in audio is the most 
								challenging technique to use when dealing with 
								Steganography. This is because the human 
								auditory system (HAS) has such a dynamic range 
								that it can listen over. To put this in 
								perspective, the (HAS) perceives over a range of 
								power greater than one million to one and a 
								range of frequencies greater than one thousand 
								to one making it extremely hard to add or remove 
								data from the original data structure. The only 
								weakness in the (HAS) comes at trying to 
								differentiate sounds (loud sounds drown out 
								quiet sounds) and this is what must be exploited 
								to encode secret messages in audio without being 
								detected.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								There are two concepts to consider before 
								choosing an encoding technique for audio. They 
								are the digital format of the audio and the 
								transmission medium of the audio.
								There are three main digital audio formats 
								typically in use. They are Sample Quantization, 
								Temporal Sampling Rate and Perceptual Sampling.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Sample Quantization which is a 16-bit linear 
								sampling architecture used by popular audio 
								formats such as (WAV and AIFF). Temporal 
								Sampling Rate uses selectable frequencies (in 
								the KHz) to sample the audio. Generally, the 
								higher the sampling rate is, the higher the 
								usable data space gets. The last audio format is 
								Perceptual Sampling. This format changes the 
								statistics of the audio drastically by encoding 
								only the parts the listener perceives, thus 
								maintaining the sound but changing the signal. 
								This format is used by the most popular digital 
								audio on the Internet today in ISO MPEG (MP3).</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Transmission medium (path the audio takes from 
								sender to receiver) must also be considered when 
								encoding secret messages in audio. There are 
								four possible transmission mediums:<br>
								1) Digital end to end - from machine to machine 
								without modification.<br>
								2) Increased/decreased resampling - the sample 
								rate is modified but remains digital.<br>
								3) Analog and resampled - signal is changed to 
								analog and resampled at a different rate. <br>
								4) Over the air - signal is transmitted into 
								radio frequencies and resampled from a 
								microphone.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								We will now look at three of the more popular 
								encoding methods for hiding data inside of 
								audio. They are low-bit encoding, phase-coding 
								and spread spectrum:</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000066">
								• </font>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Low-bit encoding embeds secret data into the 
								least significant bit (LSB) of the audio file. 
								This method is easy to incorporate but is very 
								susceptible to data loss due to channel noise 
								and resampling.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000066">
								• </font>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Phase coding substitutes the phase of an initial 
								audio segment with a reference phase that 
								represents the hidden data. This can be thought 
								of, as sort of an encryption for the audio 
								signal by using what is known as Discrete 
								Fourier Transform (DFT), which is nothing more 
								than a transformation algorithm for the audio 
								signal.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000066">
								• </font>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Spread spectrum encodes the audio over almost 
								the entire frequency spectrum. It then transmits 
								the audio over different frequencies which will 
								vary depending on what spread spectrum method is 
								used. Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) is 
								one such method that spreads the signal by 
								multiplying the source signal by some pseudo 
								random sequence known as a (CHIP). The sampling 
								rate is then used as the chip rate for the audio 
								signal communication. Spread spectrum encoding 
								techniques are the most secure means by which to 
								send hidden messages in audio, but it can 
								introduce random noise to the audio thus 
								creating the chance of data loss.</font></p>
								<p align="justify"><b>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#A80054">
								Image-based Steganography:</font></b></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Coding secret messages in digital images is by 
								far the most widely used of all methods in the 
								digital world of today? This is because it can 
								take advantage of the limited power of the human 
								visual system (HVS). Almost any plain text, 
								cipher text, image and any other media that can 
								be encoded into a bit stream can be hidden in a 
								digital image. With the continued growth of 
								strong graphics power in computers and the 
								research being put into image based 
								Steganography, this field will continue to grow 
								at a very rapid pace.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Before diving into coding techniques for digital 
								images, a brief explanation of digital image 
								architecture and digital image compression 
								techniques should be explained.
								To a computer, an image is an array of numbers 
								that represent light intensities at various 
								points, or pixels. These pixels make up the 
								images raster data. When dealing with digital 
								images for use with Steganography, 8-bit and 
								24-bit per pixel image files are typical. Both 
								have advantages and disadvantages, as we will 
								explain below. 8-bit images are a great format 
								to use because of their relatively small size. 
								The drawback is that only 256 possible colors 
								can be used which can be a potential problem 
								during encoding. Usually a gray scale color 
								palette is used when dealing with 8-bit images 
								such as (GIF) because its gradual change in 
								color will be harder to detect after the image 
								has been encoded with the secret message. 24-bit 
								images offer much more flexibility when used for 
								Steganography. The large numbers of colors (over 
								16 million) that can be used go well beyond the 
								human visual system (HVS), which makes it very 
								hard to detect once a secret message, has been 
								encoded. The other benefit is that a much larger 
								amount of hidden data can be encoded into a 
								24-bit digital image as opposed to an 8-bit 
								digital image. The one major drawback to 24-bit 
								digital images is their large size (usually in 
								MB) makes them more suspect than the much 
								smaller 8-bit digital images (usually in KB) 
								when sent over an open system such as the 
								Internet.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Digital image compression is a good solution to 
								large digital images such as the 24-bit images 
								mentioned earlier. There are two types of 
								compression used in digital images, lossy and 
								lossless. Lossy compression such as (JPEG) 
								greatly reduces the size of a digital image by 
								removing excess image data and calculating a 
								close approximation of the original image. Lossy 
								compression is usually used with 24-bit digital 
								images to reduce its size, but it does carry one 
								major drawback. Lossy compression techniques 
								increase the possibility that the uncompressed 
								secret message will lose parts of its contents 
								because of the fact that lossy compression 
								removes what it sees as excess image data. 
								Lossless compression techniques, as the name 
								suggests, keeps the original digital image in 
								tact without the chance of loss. It is for this 
								reason that it is the compression technique of 
								choice for steganographic uses. Examples of 
								lossless compression techniques are (GIF and 
								BMP). The only drawback to lossless image 
								compression is that it doesn't do a very good 
								job at compressing the size of the image data.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								We will now discuss a couple of the more popular 
								digital image encoding techniques used today. 
								They are least significant bit (LSB) encoding 
								and masking and filtering techniques:</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Least significant bit (LSB) encoding is by far 
								the most popular of the coding techniques used 
								for digital images. By using the LSB of each 
								byte (8 bits) in an image for a secret message, 
								you can store 3 bits of data in each pixel for 
								24-bit images and 1 bit in each pixel for 8-bit 
								images. As you can see, much more information 
								can be stored in a 24-bit image file. Depending 
								on the color palette used for the cover image 
								(i.e., all gray), it is possible to take 2 LSB's 
								from one byte without the human visual system (HVS) 
								being able to tell the difference. The only 
								problem with this technique is that it is very 
								vulnerable to attacks such as image changes and 
								formatting (changing from .GIF to .JPEG).</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">
								Masking and filtering techniques for digital 
								image encoding such as Digital Watermarking 
								(integrating a companies logo on there web 
								content) are more popular with lossy compression 
								techniques such as (JPEG). This technique 
								actually extends an image data by masking the 
								secret data over the original data as opposed to 
								hiding information inside of the data. Some 
								experts argue that this is definitely a form of 
								Information Hiding, but not technically 
								Steganography. The beauty of Masking and 
								filtering techniques are that they are immune to 
								image manipulation which makes there possible 
								uses very robust.<br>
								<br>
								There are many other techniques that use complex 
								algorithms, image transformation techniques and 
								image encryption techniques are still relatively 
								new, but show promise to be more secure and 
								robust ways to use digital images in 
								Steganography.</font></p>
								<p align="justify"><b>
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#A80054">
								Steganography in an open system:</font></b></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">In 
								this section we will look at some of the 
								possible applications for steganography. The 
								three most popular and researched uses for 
								steganography in an open systems environment are 
								covert channels, embedded data and digital 
								watermarking.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">Covert channels in TCP/IP involve masking 
								identification information in the TCP/IP headers 
								to hide the true identity of one or more 
								systems. This can be very useful for any secure 
								communications needs over open systems such as 
								the Internet when absolute secrecy is needed for 
								an entire communication process and not just one 
								document as mentioned next.
								Using containers (cover messages) to embed 
								secret messages into is by far the most popular 
								use of Steganography today. This method of 
								Steganography is very useful when a party must 
								send a top secret, private or highly sensitive 
								document over an open systems environment such 
								as the Internet. By embedding the hidden data 
								into the cover message and sending it, you can 
								gain a sense of security by the fact that no one 
								knows you have sent more than a harmless message 
								other than the intended recipients.</font></p>
								<p align="justify">
								<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000066">Although not a pure steganographic technique, 
								digital watermarking is very common in Today’s 
								world and does use Steganographic techniques to 
								embed information into documents. Digital 
								watermarking is usually used for copy write 
								reasons by companies or entities that wish to 
								protect their property by either embedding their 
								trademark into their property or by concealing 
								serial numbers/license information in software, 
								etc. Digital watermarking is very important in 
								the detection and prosecution of software 
								pirates and digital thieves.</font></p><hr>
